# Process


- expand shorthands with dot, e.g. `überflüss.`
- distinguish separator comma from grammatical comma
- expand alternatives, often arbitrary case-by-case, e.g. `od.`, `/`, etc.



## Problems

- hyphens can be used for word breaks across lines and/or concatenated words
  - check hyphen in word after comma if previous ends with comma, e.g. `Herauf-, Heraus-ziehen`
- commas can be grammatical and/or separational
ალთას ... ბალთას eins widerspricht
dem andern, der eine singt Dur,
der andere Moll;

- risk that introduced typos during page correction, especially when typing missing Georgian words,
  - similar characters like `ღ` and `ლ`, `ნ` and `მ`, `ჯ` and `ჟ`, `პ` and `ფ`, `ტ` and `თ`, `ბ` and `მ`, etc.
  - notation like `x|y`, `~x`, and `~-x`, etc.



## Potential remaining mistakes

- missing gender marker
- typos (since beginning or introduced later)
